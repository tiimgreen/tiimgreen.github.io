I have a **CV** available upon request.

Some past and ongoing work:

- [Tabbit](http://tiimgreen.com/blog/tables-on-console/) - a RubyGem to make simple tables in the console
- [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) - a cheat sheet on using Git and GitHub which was pretty popular
