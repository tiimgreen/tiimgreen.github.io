I'm on: [github (@tiimgreen)](http://github.com/tiimgreen) - [twitter (@tiimgreen)](http://twitter.com/tiimgreen) - [email (tiimgreen@gmail.com)](mailto:tiimgreen@gmail.com)

I make cool stuff, primarily with Ruby (Rails):

- [Toc](https://github.com/tiimgreen/toc) - RubyGem to colourise outputs to the console
- [Tabbit](https://github.com/tiimgreen/tabbit) - RubyGem to make simple tables in the console

I made a [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) that was pretty popular.
