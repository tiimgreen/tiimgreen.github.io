I'm on: [github (@tiimgreen)](http://github.com/tiimgreen) - [twitter (@tiimgreen)](http://twitter.com/tiimgreen) - [email (tiimgreen@gmail.com)](mailto:tiimgreen@gmail.com)

I have a CV available upon request.

I make cool stuff, primarily with Ruby (Rails):

- [Kodets](http://kodets.com) - an autonomous code-teaching platform designed for schools and organisations equipping people with the tools to teach people to code, complete with text editor and console to run source-code
- [Toc](http://tiimgreen.com/blog/colouring-output/) - a RubyGem to colourise outputs to the console
- [Tabbit](http://tiimgreen.com/blog/tables-on-console/) - a RubyGem to make simple tables in the console
- I made a [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) which was pretty popular
