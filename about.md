I am a student, currently studying for my **GCSEs**.

I'm on: [github (@tiimgreen)](http://github.com/tiimgreen) - [twitter (@tiimgreen)](http://twitter.com/tiimgreen) - [email (tiimgreen@gmail.com)](mailto:tiimgreen@gmail.com)

I have a **CV** available upon request.

I've been making and breaking cool stuff, primarily with **Ruby (Rails)** since 2011.

Some past and ongoing work:

- [Kodets](http://kodets.com) - a free, autonomous code-teaching platform designed for schools and organisations
- [Toc](http://tiimgreen.com/blog/colouring-output/) - a RubyGem to colourise outputs to the console
- [Tabbit](http://tiimgreen.com/blog/tables-on-console/) - a RubyGem to make simple tables in the console
- [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) - a cheat sheet on using Git and GitHub which was pretty popular

All code is available under the [MIT License](/mit) unless otherwise stated.
