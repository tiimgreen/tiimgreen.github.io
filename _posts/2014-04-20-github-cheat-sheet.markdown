# GitHub Cheat Sheet

The [GitHub Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet) was inspired by [Zack Holman](http://zachholman.com/)'s talks at [Aloha Ruby Conf](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/1229-aloharuby2012-git-and-github-secrets) (2012) and [WDCNZ](https://vimeo.com/72955426) (2013).

Initially, I made the guide purely so I could remember all the cool features in the video. I wanted a place where I could refer back so I wouldn't have to watch both videos over and over. After making the draft I quite liked to so posted it on the Reddit programming section to see if others would appreciate it and went to bed. I woke to 250 stars which quickly grew to 1,000 in less than 12 hours. Shit. Turns out people actually liked it. 1,000 quickly turned into 2,000 which turned into 3,000, at the time of writing it currently has 4,967 stars.

After having the repo live for a few days, I realised it wasn't climbing the ranks of the Trending page on GitHub. I shot an Email to support and got this response:

> Hi Tim,
>
> It seems that your repository got too popular too quickly and tripped some of our anti-spam measures.  Sorry for the trouble.
>
> Cheers,
> Steven!

For a repo that wasn't even meant to go public, thats not bad!

Some of my personal favourites include:

- [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet#keyboard-shortcuts) to quickly navigate repos
- [Hub](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet#hub) a simple, easy to use git wrapper
- [Closing Issues with Commit Messages](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet#closing-issues-via-commit-messages) an incredibly simple yet incredibly useful feature

Got a cool feature you can't see on there? [Contribute](https://github.com/tiimgreen/github-cheat-sheet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
